# Drought-Prediction-using-Weather-and-Soil-data

1.1 Background
Drought is a common hazard in many parts of the world and its incidence will increase with climate change. Drought has a major impact on ecosystems, agriculture and communities and poses a threat to food, water and economic security. Therefore, drought forecasting is an important tool for reducing the impact of drought and developing early warning and effective management strategies.

1.2 Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a drought prediction machine learni
ng model that can predict future drought conditions based on past weather data and
other factors. Specifically, this project aims to:
 Analysis provides Kaggle data on climate data on drought events in the United States.
 Preprocessing and data preparation for machine learning algorithms.
 Develop machine learning models for drought prediction, including decision trees,
random forest, ridge regression, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN).
 Evaluate and compare the performance of designs based on different metrics inclu
ding accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
 examines the socioeconomic and environmental impact of drought forecasting and
explores the feasibility of integrating these factors into the design model.

1.3 Scope and Limitations
The scope of this project is limited to a Kaggle weather dataset on drought conditions
in the United States, and the design is specific to the data in this document. This study
does not consider other regions or countries and results may not be generalizable to other situations. The models developed in this project are based on historical data and
may not be suitable for extreme weather forecasts outside the range of historical data.


2. PROBLEM STATEMENT –
2.1 Motivation
Drought is a serious threat that can cause serious damage to agriculture, ecosystems and communities. Accurate and timely forecasting of drought is important for effective management and mitigation strategies. However, traditional weather forecasting methods may not be able to capture the complexity and uncertainty of weather leading to inaccurate forecasts. Additionally, the effects of climate change, such as changing precipitation patterns and higher temperatures, make it difficult to accurately predict weather using traditional methods.
Machine learning techniques show promise in improving the accuracy and speedof weather forecasting by integrating multiple environmental and meteorological factors.
However, more research and development in this area is needed to fully exploit the potential of machine learning for drought prediction.

2.2 Dataset Description
The "US Drought Meteorological Data" dataset available on Kaggle is a collection
of meteorological data for the United States, which has been used to monitor and
study drought conditions in the country. The data was compiled by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and covers a 20-year period
from 2000 to 2020.
The dataset includes information on various weather parameters such as
temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, solar
radiation, soil moisture, and evaporation. Data are available at daily, weekly, and
monthly intervals and are provided for various spatial resolutions, including state,
county, climate division, and climate region.
The dataset consists of several CSV files, each of which contains data for a specific
meteorological parameter. The files are named according to the parameters they
contain and are organized by spatial resolution and time interval. For example, the

file "us-droughts-meteorological-data-county-weekly.csv" contains weekly
meteorological data at the county level, while the file "us-droughts-meteorologicaldata-state-monthly.csv" contains monthly state data. level.
Each file contains multiple columns of data, with each row representing a single
observation. Columns include a unique identifier for the location (eg, state or county
name), date of observation, and value of the meteorological parameter being
measured. For some parameters, such as precipitation, multiple columns are
included to represent different types of measurements (eg, total precipitation,
snowfall, and snow depth).
The dataset also includes several additional files, such as metadata files that provide
a more detailed description of the data and the sources used to compile it, as well
as files that provide mappings between the location identifiers used in the data and
other location codes such as FIPS. Codes
Overall, this dataset provides a comprehensive collection of meteorological data for
the United States, which can be used for a variety of research and applications
related to drought monitoring and management, weather forecasting, and climate
modeling.
2.3. Specific Problem Faced
The specific problem this project addresses is the development of machine learni
ng models for weather forecasting using weather history. The aim is to create a
model that can predict drought conditions with good accuracy and recovery and
gain insight into the root causes and potential effects of drought. The model can
help guide better drought management and mitigation strategies and increase dr
ought resilience.
This study addresses the following research questions:
 How can machine learning be used to improve the accuracy and speed of weather
forecasting?

 What are the most important environmental and climatic factors that lead to such
conditions?
 How to use historical climate data to develop machine learning models for dr
ought prediction?
 How and how effective is the drought prediction machine learning model comp
ared to traditional methods?
2.4. Detailed Explanation
The project addresses the problem of accurately predicting drought conditions th
at can have a major impact on ecosystems, agriculture and communities. Traditi
onal climate forecasting methods rely on analysis of past weather data to predic
t future conditions, but these methods may not capture the complexity and true un
knowns of weather, resulting in erroneous forecasts. On the other hand, machi
ne learning techniques show promise in improving the accuracy and speed of cli
mate measurements by combining multiple environmental and meteorological f
actors.
This study developed and compared several learning models, including decision
trees, random forest, ridge regression, and Knearest neighbors (KNN) to accurately predict drought status. The model was trai
ned on a dataset containing historical US weather data from the Kaggle platform.
The data includes variables such as temperature, precipitation, humidity and wind
speed and is used to predict drought conditions in each region.
This project also uses techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversamp
ling Technique) analysis to resolve class differences in data and improve model
performance. The project has determined the most accurate and effective mo
del work for weather forecasting by analyzing the performance of each model a
ccording to criteria such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
